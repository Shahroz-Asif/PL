Each of the Python regular expression matching functions are useful for different purposes.

re.match always starts at the beginning of the string.

re.search steps through the string from the start looking for the first match. It stops when it finds a match.

re.findall returns a list of all the search matches.

In all the cases above, if there's a group in the regex pattern, then the item you get back is a tuple of the full match followed by each group match in the order they appear in the regex pattern.
